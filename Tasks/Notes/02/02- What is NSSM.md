[**NSSM** (Non-Sucking Service Manager) is a utility for **Microsoft Windows** operating systems that allows you to run any application as a **Windows service** easily](https://nssm.cc/download)[1](https://nssm.cc/download). Here are some key points about NSSM:

1. **Purpose**: NSSM helps you convert any executable file into a Windows service.
2. **Monitoring Services**: Unlike other utilities, NSSM actively monitors services. [If a service fails, it detects the failure and restarts it promptly](https://www.helpmegeek.com/run-applications-as-windows-service/)[2](https://www.helpmegeek.com/run-applications-as-windows-service/).
3. **Compatibility**: NSSM works on Windows 2000 and later versions, including Windows 7, 8, and 10. [Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions are available, and you can choose the appropriate one based on your system](https://nssm.cc/download)[1](https://nssm.cc/download).
4. **Usage**: When installing a service using NSSM, remember that the actual program entered into the services database is `nssm.exe` itself. Avoid moving or deleting `nssm.exe` after installation. [If you need to change the path to `nssm.exe`, you can either remove and reinstall the service or edit the registry key `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\servicename\ImagePath` to reflect the new location](https://nssm.cc/usage)[3](https://nssm.cc/usage).
