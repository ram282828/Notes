#### Ice Mitigation Actions (IMA): Yawing

Yaw actions allows rotating the Turbines nacelle to rotate to direction pointed in the configuration. Thanks to that, the infrastructure underneath the Turbine can be protected, as the area of ice falls can be specifically chosen.

Turbine Yawing brings also all the benefits of Pausing the Turbine, as Turbine Pausing is one of the Yawing steps.
