#### Ice Mitigation Sequence

Each of Ice Detection Methods can have its own chain of actions assigned to it. The chain of actions consists of 3 elements:
- **Pre-Mitigation Action** – an action, that prepares turbine to the ice mitigation,
- **Mitigation Action** – an action, that prevents ice from getting iced or deice blades when already iced up,
- **Post-Mitigation Action** – an action, that is performed when Mitigation Action is finished.

Each Turbine can have individual Ice Mitigation Sequences assigned to individual Ice Detection Methods, as chose of actions depends on the turbine location.
