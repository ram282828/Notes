#### Ice Mitigation Actions (IMA): Pausing/Release

Simplest action, that can be performed, is Turbine pausing. This action on its own don’t mitigate the ice, but by stopping the blades rotation, it’s easier to make ice being melted by sun or increasing ambient temperature.

Also, use of the Pause action, help to mitigate the risk of ice being thrown by rotating blades when melting and getting lose.
