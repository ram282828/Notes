#### Ice Mitigation Actions (IMA): Vestas De-Icing System (VDS)

Vestas De-Icing System (VDS for short) is one of the systems that actively helps getting rid of the ice on the blades. The system can be activated, when Turbine is drawn to a halt. Then, a hot air is being blown inside the turbine blades, which heats them up and get ice melted.

VDS cycle consists of two main parts:
- De-icing part – when **hot air is blown into the blades** to heat them up (90min),
- Cooling part – when **blades are left to cool down** before Turbine can be relesed (30min).

Maximal length of the VDS deicing cycle takes up to 2h, but when ice is no longer detected, then the action can be aborted earlier.
