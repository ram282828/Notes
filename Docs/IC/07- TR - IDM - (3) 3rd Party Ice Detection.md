#### Ice Detection Methods (IDM): 3rd Party Ice Detection

3rd Party Ice Detection can be any sensor, which is accessible by the SCADA software by use of AP (OPC) communication protocol. 
The output of the sensor must be binary â€“ detects ice or not.

Such a sensor can be configured in the system and used to detect ice on a given turbine.

`Note: 3rd Party Ice Detection is currently not available. It will be added in future releases.`
