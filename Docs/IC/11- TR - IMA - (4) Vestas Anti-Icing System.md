#### Ice Mitigation Actions (IMA): Vestas Anti-Icing System (VAS)

Vestas Anti-Icing System (**VAS** for short) is a system, that uses heating panels mounted on the blades surface. 
VAS can work in two modes – VAS Rotating (**VASrt** for short) and VAS StandStill (**VASss** for short).

**VASrt** allows to mitigate icing while turbine is still operational. This mode reduces the power production loss, but also requires less severe weather conditions to be effective.

**VASss** pauses the turbine while mitigating the ice. In this mode mitigating the ice comes easier, but the power is not being produced.


Before VAS is started, the ambient weather conditions are being checked, to check if it is possible for VAS to be effective at all in current conditions. 
The set of environmental measures being considered, when checking it, is names Operational Envelope. VAS action will be started only, if Operational Envelope conditions are met.

VAS heating panels supports multiple heating levels. When VAS is activated, the icing trend is being monitored internally by the turbine and panels heating level is being adjusted automatically.

If top heating level is being used for too long time, the following takes place:
- If in **VASrt mode** – VAS is being switched to VASss mode,
- If in **VASss mode** – VAS is considered not effective and aborted.
