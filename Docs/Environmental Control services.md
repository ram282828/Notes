The idea behind the Environmental Control services is to provide functionality that, based on the analysis of the environmental conditions, can act to meet certain goals. At the moment of writing this document, there are 4 Environmental Control services in total:


| Environmental Control service                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | #                                         |

| <br>- **Bat Protection Service** – its goal is to pause the turbine during bat horde passes thought Plant perimeter. This prevents bats from being killed by turbines.<br><br>                                                                                                              | ![[Pasted image 20240617134312.png\|500]] |
| <br>- **Flicker Avoidance Service** – its goal is to pause the turbine, when rotor casts shadow on the windows of the buildings. This prevents humans from getting epileptic attacks due to the flicker frequency as well as simply getting annoyed by the flickering shadows.<br><br>      | ![[Pasted image 20240618125559.png\|500]] |
| <br>- **Aviation Light Service** – its goal is to detect passing aircrafts and warn them about the high Turbine towers according to light intensity and local law regulations. This prevents from excessive light flashing with maintaining the safety level required for aviation.<br><br> | ![[Pasted image 20240618125737.png\|500]] |
| <br>- **Ice Control Service** – its goal is to detect icing events on the turbine blades. When such an event is detected, actions configured for given turbine are being perform, so that ice can be melted to increase power production or safety in the perimeter.<br><br>                | ![[Pasted image 20240618130038.png\|500]] |


All described services are accessible from common Environmental Control UI. 
The UI allows user to configure the desired behavior for each service as well as monitor the status of the park. 
Some of the views are shared across all the services, but each of them also has its dedicated tab, which contains set of pages related only to this single service.
